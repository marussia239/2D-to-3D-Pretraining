# Master Thesis for Computer Science degree at University of Genoa

### Abstract:

Medical imaging has been significantly impacted by deep learning's revolution in domains requiring the interpretation of visual data. The availability of high-resolution 3D volumetric data, such as those required for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT), significantly enhances diagnostic precision. However, there exist computational challenges when training neural networks on such data. Fully 3D neural networks frequently require powerful GPUs, longer training times, and higher memory demands. Researchers and practitioners with limited resources may not be able to reach this degree of computational requirement due to its potentially unaffordable cost. This thesis explores a method that combines the spatial representation of 3D models with the effectiveness of 2D pre-trained networks. Here we propose the Axial-Coronal-Sagittal (ACS) convolutions, which use effective 2D weights to capture 3D context by applying 2D convolutional kernels independently along three orthogonal planes. Our method makes it easier to initialize and fine-tune 3D networks based on pre-trained 2D weights without raising computing expenses.
